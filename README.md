> [!TIP]
> :one: - This list is my recommend order I would do the projects in.
> 
> :clock2: - If possible, triple book evaluations at the same time for the same project (be evaluated once instead of 3 seperate times).
>
> :white_check_mark: - 62 Evaluation Points (without any project failed) to complete all of the Common Core projects.
>
> üßë‚Äçüè´ - Most projects will give you 1 Evaluation Point (with the exception of Born2BeRoot, IRC and Transcendence - 2 Evaluation Points) when you evaluate someone else's project.
